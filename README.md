# Regression---MPG
The MPG dataset contains details about vehicles from 3 different countries. In this Project we first try to gain an understanding of the factors affecting the milage of the vehciles and then try and predict the milage(mpg) of vehicles using different algorithms namely:
1 . Linear Regression.
2 . Decision Tree.
3 . Gradient Boosting.
4 . Gradient Search CV.

In the end we compare the performance of the models using mean_squared_error and check which model performed the best.
